<p><div class="description"><h4>The KogeCoin Genesis Airdrop is Now Over!</h4></div></p>

<p>KogeCoin was launched via airdrop to the community we serve, the Polygon/Matic Network users, back when only QuickSwap was available. By doing so, we were able to build up an early group of proven HODLers who has not sold their bags despite large price fluctuations in the 4 week airdrop period. We believe that this is a much more solid foundation to build upon than the traditional launch which might be sniped by bots/whales.</p>

<p>If you missed the airdrop, don't fret! About 90% of our supply was unclaimed, and will  be distributed to holders via KogeCoin and KogeCoin LP staking after June 10. So, feel free to <a href="/howtobuy">buy</a> some KogeCoins before then if you want to be able to participate in staking right when it begins.</p>
