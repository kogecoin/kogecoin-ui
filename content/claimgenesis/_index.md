<p><div class="description"><h4>The KogeCoin Genesis Airdrop is Now Over!</h4></div></p>

<p>KogeCoin was launched via airdrop on Polygon back when only QuickSwap was available. By doing so, we were able to build up an early group of proven HODLers who has not sold their bags despite large price fluctuations in the 4 week airdrop period. We believe that this is a much more solid foundation to build upon than the traditional launch which might be sniped by bots/whales.</p>

<p>If you missed the airdrop, don't fret! About 90% of our supply was unclaimed, and is being distributed to holders via <a href="https://kogefarm.io/farms">KogeCoin and KogeCoin LP staking</a>.</p>
