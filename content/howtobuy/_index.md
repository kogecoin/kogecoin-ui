<li>
We are excited to announce that you can now directly swap BSC tokens for KogeCoin on the Polygon network through the <a href="https://bridge.evodefi.com/exchange?from=bsc&to=polygon&in=0x8AC76a51cc950d9822D68b83fE1Ad97B32Cd580d&out=0x13748d548D95D78a3c83fe3F32604B4796CFfa23">Evodefi Bridge</a>
You no longer have to go searching for a BSC â€”> Polygon bridge, bridge a token, and then swap that token for KogeCoin in a separate transaction.

Instead, using the Evodefi bridge, connect your BSC and Polygon wallets, provide the token you'd like to swap for KogeCoin on BSC, choose KOGE on the Polygon network, and you're done!
