<p><h4>Why buy KogeCoin? To have some ownership in KogeFarm!</h4></p>

<p><h4>
From Fiat via <a href="https://www.dharma.io/affiliate/join/KOGE-FARM">Dharma</a>:</h4>
<ol>
<li>We are excited to announce that Dharma.io has partnered with KogeFarm to allow U.S. users the ability to buy Koge directly from fiat!</li>
Rather than beating around the bush, we will get straight to the details.</li>
<li>If you’re ready to get started — click on our written or video tutorial for instructions on how to use Dharma. To receive the $50 incentive you’ll need to download Dharma through our referral link (also at the top of this article).</li>
</ol>
<b>What You Get</b>
<ul>
<li>$50 ETH sign on bonus thanks to Dharma. After connecting your U.S. bank and buying at least $500 of crypto over any period of time, Dharma will give you 50 dollars worth of ETH on the polygon network.</li>
<li>Never miss the dip again. With the ability to buy crypto from fiat you no longer have to wait the time it takes to get funds on polygon and potentially miss a KogeCoin dip. Buy it instantly.</li>
<li>1inch exchange rates. Dharma.io uses the dex aggregator 1inch. As of recently, U.S. users have been banned from using the 1inch website, but by using Dharma, they have full access to 1inches rates (which with larger trades I’ve seen savings of $10 or more compared to quickswap)</li>
</ul>
<b>What KogeFarm Gets</b>
<ul>
<li>50% of all trade fees generated by Dharma.io for the users we onboard using the referral link. Where does this money go? Straight to increasing the price of KogeCoin. Any trade revenue is sent to the KogeFarm profit wallet to buy KogeCoin ever hour and burn it. So 100% of trading fees go directly into increasing the value of KogeCoin.</li>
</ul>
<b>What Dharma Gets</b>
<ul>
<li>Increased exposure from more users using its trading services and smart wallet. Using the wallet connect feature, you can stake KogeCoin directly from Dharma (after the 6 day settlement period), or send it to a different wallet such as MetaMask (see our tutorial for how to do that).</li>
</ul>

We are excited to announce that you can now directly swap BSC tokens for KogeCoin on the Polygon network through the <a href="https://bridge.evodefi.com/exchange?from=bsc&to=polygon&in=0x8AC76a51cc950d9822D68b83fE1Ad97B32Cd580d&out=0x13748d548D95D78a3c83fe3F32604B4796CFfa23">Evodefi Bridge</a>.
You no longer have to go searching for a BSC —> Polygon bridge, bridge a token, and then swap that token for KogeCoin in a separate transaction.

Instead, using the Evodefi bridge, connect your BSC and Polygon wallets, provide the token you'd like to swap for KogeCoin on BSC, choose KOGE on the Polygon network, and you're done!
